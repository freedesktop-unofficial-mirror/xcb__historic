Description: X C Binding
 Xlib has been the standard C binding for the X Window System protocol
 for many years now. It is an excellent piece of work, but there are
 applications for which it is not ideal. XCB builds on nearly two
 decades of experience with X specifically and software engineering in
 general in an effort to replace the aging Xlib code base.
