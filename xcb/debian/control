Description: X C Binding
 Xlib has been the standard C binding for the X Window System protocol for
 many years now. It is an excellent piece of work, but there are applications
 for which it is not ideal. XCB builds on nearly two decades of experience
 with X specifically and software engineering in general in an effort to
 replace the aging Xlib code base.
 .
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using
 XCB.
