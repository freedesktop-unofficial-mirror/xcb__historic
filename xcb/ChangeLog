2005-12-12  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* tests/check_public.c:
	Fix segfault in fail_unless calls and provide more useful error
	messages. Also remove DISPLAY from the environment and test
	ParseDisplay on a null pointer.

2005-12-07  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb.h, src/xcb_in.c:
	Use GCC attribute extension, if available, to mark some
	functions deprecated; and rename XCBWaitEvent to
	XCBWaitForEvent, with a deprecated backwards compatibility
	function.

2005-12-07  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb.h, src/xcb_conn.c, src/xcb_util.c:
	Rename XCBConnect to XCBConnectToFD, and implement XCBConnect
	and XCBConnectToDisplayWithAuthInfo, as specified by the XcbApi
	documentation. Provide a trivial implementation of deprecated
	XCBConnectBasic for backwards compatibility. Fix XCBParseDisplay
	to accept a null screen pointer.

2005-09-30  Trevor Woerner <twoerner.x@gmail.com>

	reviewer: Jamey Sharp <jamey@minilop.net>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.am,
	  src/check_all.c, src/check_public.c, src/check_suites.h:
	Created a new directory called "tests" where the unit tests
	will reside, separate from other files. Moved the unit
	test files from the "src" directory into the new "tests"
	directory.

	* configure.ac, tests/CheckLog.xsl, tests/.cvsignore,
	  tests/Makefile.am, tests/check_all.c:
	Added an XSLT transform to post-process the XML log file which
	is generated by the unit test suite into an HTML page. Added
	the necessary hooks into the build system to have this
	translation occur when necessary as part of the build process.

2005-08-15  Trevor Woerner <twoerner.x@gmail.com>

	reviewer: Jamey Sharp <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	Make builds work when the source and build directories
	are different.

2005-08-03  Trevor Woerner <twoerner.x@gmail.com>

	reviewer: Jamey Sharp <jamey@minilop.net>

	* configure.ac:
	Allow people to not have check as long as they have at
	least automake version 1.9. Older versions of automake
	still work as long as check is installed or the NoCheck
	instructions are followed.

2005-07-21  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_conn.c:
	Fix one uninitialized memory warning from Valgrind.
	More will have to wait.

2005-07-21  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_ext.c:
	Fix memory leak reported by Carl Worth (thanks Carl!).

2005-05-22  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Permit unions to have fixed-length list fields.

2005-05-21  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	In function parameters and structure fields, line up field names in
	the same starting column.

2005-05-17  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Make header files self-sufficient, by including xcb.h in the
	generated headers rather than the generated sources.

	* src/xcbext.h:
	Make xcbext.h self-sufficient, by including xcb.h.

2005-05-17  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Line up function parameters with opening parenthesis.

2005-05-17  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Improve whitespace output on function declarations.

2005-04-23  Jeremy Kolb  <jkolb@brandeis.edu>
	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Added list support for typedefs.
	GLX now compiles.

2005-04-23  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Allow protocol descriptions to explicitly qualify types with a
	namespace, which should be the value of the header attribute from
	the protocol description containing the desired type.

2005-04-10  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb.h, src/xcb_in.c:
	New public function XCBGetRequestRead: returns the last sequence
	number that the server is known to have processed. This function
	enables apps to determine whether forcing a cookie is going to
	block.

2005-04-09  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_ext.c:
	Implement XCBPrefetchExtensionData. An extension can now be in
	one of three states in a particular connection's cache: not
	queried; query cookie available; and query reply available.

2005-04-09  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_ext.c, src/xcbint.h:
	Assign a display-independent unique integer to each XCBExtension
	structure. Use a map instead of a list for the extension cache.
	Key the map on the assigned integer.

2005-04-06  Jeremy Kolb  <jkolb@brandeis.edu>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Added support for c types float and double.
	Needed for GLX extension.

2005-04-02  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Workaround for XSLT processors that can't understand attribute
	values of the form '{{ "{...}" }}'. (What? That looks completely
	clear to me. *grin*)

2005-04-01  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_list.c:
	Make the _destroy operations no-op on null pointers.

2005-03-31  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb.h, src/xcb_conn.c, src/xcb_out.c, src/xcbint.h:
	Lazily check for BIG-REQUESTS support. The first call to
	XCBGetMaximumRequestLength takes the two-round-trip penalty for
	discovering BIG-REQUESTS support, and caches the result for
	subsequent calls. Also XCBSendRequest is now careful to only ask
	for the true maximum request length if the length from the
	connection setup data isn't sufficient for the current request.

2005-03-31  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_in.c:
	Fix X error handling to, uh, not hang.

2005-03-30  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_in.c, src/xcbint.h:
	Accept zero or more replies to any request. Eliminates, for the
	moment, nearly all run-time error checking regarding the number
	of replies expected for a particular request. Also breaks the
	unexpected reply callback, which is OK because I was going to
	remove it anyway, and now I've done so.

2005-03-30  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_list.c, src/xcbint.h:
	Add a map ADT implemented using the list ADT.

2005-03-28  Vincent Torri  <torri@iecn.u-nancy.fr>

	* doc/tutorial/index.html, doc/tutorial/xcb.css:
	Add a tutorial

2005-03-27  Jeremy Kolb  <jkolb@brandeis.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	Added xf86dri (xcb-proto/src/extensions/xf86dri.h).
	Removed compilation of record as it's broken.

2005-03-25  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_in.c:
	Instead of storing a pending flag per reply record, look in the
	readers list to find out whether there's a reader waiting for
	the reply we've just been asked to wait for.

2005-03-25  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_list.c, src/xcbint.h:
	Add _xcb_queue_is_empty.

2005-03-25  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_in.c, src/xcb_list.c, src/xcbint.h:
	Add a queue ADT. Currently implemented using the list ADT, but
	analysis will probably suggest a better data structure. The
	split is intended to help that analysis.

2005-03-25  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_in.c, src/xcb_list.c, src/xcbint.h:
	Remove _xcb_list_length. (Two callers in xcb_in didn't actually
	care about the returned value beyond "empty" or "non-empty",
	which they can get other ways.) _xcb_in_events_length became
	obsolete in the process, and I took _xcb_list_clear out of
	xcbint.h while I was at it because only _xcb_list_delete calls
	it these days.

2005-03-25  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb.h, src/xcb_in.c:
	Remove XCBEventQueueLength and XCBEventQueueClear: they're not
	part of the new API, and they interfere with analysis of the
	_xcb_list implementation.

2005-03-24  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* configure.ac:
	Change pdx.freedesktop.org to lists.freedesktop.org in package
	email address.

2005-03-23  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_conn.c, src/xcb_in.c:
	avn@daemon.hole.ru pointed out two memory leaks in XCB, which
	this update fixes. I also introduced a third a couple of days
	ago, which this fixes as well.

2005-03-23  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_in.c:
	Quit storing an "error" flag: it's redundant with the contents
	of the packet that it was stored with.

2005-03-22  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_in.c, src/xcbint.h:
	My recent Xlib patch stressed XCB's pending reply queue in ways
	it has never been stressed before, with thousands of entries.
	Profiling revealed that wake_up_next_reader was taking most of
	the cycles of my test app with its linear search of the reply
	queue. So I gave it its own 'readers' queue, which can have at
	most one entry per thread, and which can be no more than the
	number of pending replies. In the current implementation the
	readers queue uses only constant-time operations, too.

2005-03-20  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_in.c:
	Wait for the last known read sequence number to pass the request
	we're waiting for, instead of checking whether data has arrived
	for the current request. Causes null to be returned if somebody
	screwed up by expecting a reply when none can come; relied on by
	new Xlib/XCB bits that intentionally and routinely screw up this
	way because the API doesn't give them enough information.

	* src/xcb_list.c, src/xcbint.h:
	Add _xcb_list_peek_head so Xlib doesn't have to repeatedly
	remove and re-insert the item at the head of its new
	pending_requests queue. Profiling showed that was a significant
	performance hit for the above-mentioned patch and with this
	three-line function apps are actually usable again.

2004-11-26  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	In do-request processing, use the existing num-parts variable
	rather than recalculating the same expression.

2004-11-26  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	  * Add a list of known core types, and don't search all the
	    protocol descriptions for types in that list.  This
	    significantly shortens the processing time.
	  * Search for all definitions of a non-core type, not just the
	    first, in order to check for duplicate definitions.
	  * Add an error message for non-core types with no definitions
	    found.

2004-11-10  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Don't create a separate local variable for exprfields, and change
	an explicit xsl:for-each to an xsl:apply-templates.

2004-11-10  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Prefix variables in request functions with "xcb_" to avoid
	collisions with field names.

2004-11-09  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	* src/xcb_out.c:
	* src/xcbext.h:
	More API changes: Put constant request-specific data into a static
	const structure in each request function.

2004-11-09  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	Add support for an <indent> tag in a function body, which indents
	the <l>s it contains.

	* debian/.cvsignore:
	debian/copyright is a generated file, so add it to
	debian/.cvsignore
	
2004-11-08  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_conn.c:
	Make the __thread-based assertion a compile-time
	option, defaulting to off. It breaks on many systems
	and isn't critical to XCB's functionality.

2004-11-07  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* c-client.xsl:
	Update XSLT to deal with change from extension element to
	extension-name and extension-xname attributes on xcb element.

2004-11-06  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* xcb.h:
	* xcb_auth.c:
	* xcb_conn.c:
	* xcb_ext.c:
	* xcb_in.c:
	* xcb_list.c:
	* xcb_out.c:
	* xcb_util.c:
	* xcb_xid.c:
	* xcbext.h:
	* xcbint.h:
	Include license in every file rather than referencing COPYING.
	Update copyright notices to 2004.

	* COPYING:
	Remove non-applicable licenses from COPYING file.

2004-11-06  Josh Triplett  <josh@freedesktop.org>

	* configure.ac:
	* src/.cvsignore:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/xcb.h:
	Merged changes for XML-XCB project.

	* src/c-client.xsl:
	* src/xcb.h:
	Add XSLT binding generator and non-M4 version of xcb.h.
	
	* src/client-c.xcb:
	* src/xcb.h.m4:
	Remove M4 binding generator and M4 version of xcb.h.

	* debian/changelog:
	* debian/control:
	* debian/copyright.debian:
	* debian/rules:
	Updated Debian packaging.

2004-09-30  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcbext.h:
	* src/xcb_in.c:
	* src/client-c.xcb:
	Renamed XCBWaitReply to XCBWaitForReply for new API.

2004-09-30  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	Fix build failure when compiling tests.

2004-09-29  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb.h.m4:
	* src/xcb_in.c:
	Added XCBPollForEvent function from new API.

2004-09-29  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb.h.m4:
	* src/xcbext.h:
	* src/client-c.xcb:
	* src/xcb_ext.c:
	Update the extension cache for its new API. The
	optimizations that this API enables are not yet
	implemented, but the current implementation should
	at least function correctly.

2004-09-29  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_util.c:
	* src/xcbext.h:
	Oops, XCBPopcount was supposed to change argument
	types too.

2004-09-29  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/client-c.xcb:
	* src/xcb_util.c:
	* src/xcbext.h:
	Renamed XCBOnes to XCBPopcount as per new API spec.

2004-09-29  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcbext.h:
	* src/xcb.h.m4:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/client-c.xcb:
	* src/xcb_in.c:
	* src/xcb_out.c:
	* src/xcb_util.c:
	* src/xcb_xid.c:
	Moved declarations that are only useful to protocol
	implementations into a separate header file,
	xcbext.h.

2004-09-28  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcbint.h:
	* src/xcb_conn.c:
	Add internal sanity check macros for sequence
	numbers, and invoke them every time _xcb_conn_wait
	is entered.

2004-09-28  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/client-c.xcb:
	Allow LISTPARAMs to omit the length argument. When
	generating C code, a LOCALPARAM is automatically
	generated for the length if the length argument is
	omitted.

2004-08-13  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* configure.ac:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/.cvsignore:
	* src/check_all.c:
	* src/check_suites.h:
	* src/check_public.c:
	Add the first unit tests for XCB. This adds a build
	dependency on 'check'; I hope somebody will make it
	more of a build recommendation.

2004-08-13  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_conn.c:
	Add a sanity check: assert() that _xcb_conn_wait
	will not be re-entered within the same thread. This
	turns out not to be true in some current buggy code.
	Xlib re-enters from _XAsyncReplyHandler in
	src/xcl/display.c; and the X Test Suite seems to
	catch SIGABRT and continue running.

2004-08-10  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_out.c:
	I misread the BIG-REQUESTS specification. The long
	length field needs to count itself too.

2004-07-24  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/client-c.xcb:
	Renamed functions that return new iterators to
	*Iter, to avoid conflict with similar functions that
	return arrays.

	Deprecating ARRAYFIELD in favor of LISTFIELD, which
	now generates both array and iterator accessors. You
	get an array accessor as long as the element type is
	fixed length; you get an interator accessor as long
	as the base type has an iterator. You always get a
	'Length' function.

2004-07-24  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_auth.c:
	Bart cleaned up some code that I made ugly, and
	I'm fixing a warning that resulted from a static
	function being created but not necessarily used.

2004-07-07  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_xid.c:
	OK, it might be a good idea to commit something
	that compiles. I thought I'd tested this change...

2004-07-06  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcbint.h:
	* src/xcb_xid.c:
	Added support for the XC-Misc extension's ability
	to request more XIDs from the server when the
	client runs out of them.

2004-07-06  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb.h.m4:
	* src/xcb_auth.c:
	* src/xcb_util.c:
	Removed XCBNextNonce, and the nonce parameter of
	XCBGetAuthInfo, from the API. XCB can compute
	that just fine without help from the application.

2004-07-06  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	Importing part of patches, adding SYNC, by
	Mikko Markus Torni <mikko.markus.torni@iki.fi>.
	This needed better padding computation in XCB
	before it could be implemented cleanly.

2004-07-02  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	Importing part of patches, adding XC-MISC, by
	Mikko Markus Torni <mikko.markus.torni@iki.fi>.

2004-07-02  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb.h.m4:
	* src/xcb_in.c:
	Remove XCBEventQueueRemove and XCBEventQueueFind.
	Their existence in the API constrains the
	implementation, and they're not useful for real
	code, like toolkits, anyway.

2004-07-02  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/client-c.xcb:
	* src/xcb.h.m4:
	XCB headers are now compatible with C++ source.

2004-07-02  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/client-c.xcb:
	* src/xcb.h.m4:
	Keith's fix for padding didn't quite work, despite
	looking quite sensible at the time. Replaced
	XCB_TYPE_CEIL with XCB_TYPE_PAD and made all the
	iterators, lists, and arrays count the number of
	bytes from the beginning of the current request.

2004-07-02  Jamey Sharp  <jamey@minilop.net>

	* src/xcb_out.c:
	* src/xcbint.h:
	Force a response from the server if we haven't seen
	one in 65530 requests. If you don't do this, XCB
	gets confused the next time it waits for a reply.

2004-06-16  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* src/client-c.xcb:
	* src/xcb.h.m4:
	Must round datatype lengths to 4-byte boundary for
	NEXTFIELD and End macros.  Created new XCB_TYPE_CEIL
	macro for this purpose and used it in a couple of
	places.  It is to be hoped that this represents all
	of the locations that need changing...
