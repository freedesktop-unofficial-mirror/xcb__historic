      <p>
      This tutorial is based on the
      <a href="http://users.actcom.co.il/~choo/lupg/tutorials/xlib-programming/xlib-programming.html">Xlib Tutorial</a>
      written by <a href="mailto:choor@atcom.co.il">Guy Keren</a>. The
      author allowed me to take some parts of his text, mainly the text which
      deals with the X Windows generality.
      </p>
      <p>
      This tutorial is intended to people who want to start to program
      with the <a href="http://xcb.freedesktop.org">XCB</a>
      library. As for the <a href="http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/introduction">Xlib</a>
      library, it is useless and a real X 
      programmer should use a much higher level of abstraction, such
      as using Motif,
      <a href="http://www.lesstif.org">LessTiff</a>,
      <a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK</a>,
      <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">QT</a> or
      <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">EWL</a>. However,
      we need to start somewhere. More than this, knowing how things
      work down below is never a bad idea.
      </p>
      <p>
      After reading this tutorial, one should be able to write very
      simple graphical programs, but not programs with a descent user
      interface. For such programs, one of the previously mentioned
      library should be used.
      </p>
      <p>
      But what is XCB ? Xlib has been
      the standard C binding for the <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X
      Window System</a> protocol for many years now. It is an
      excellent piece of work, but there are applications for which it
      is not ideal, for example
      <ul>
        <li><b>Small platforms</b>: Xlib is a large piece of code, and
	it's difficult to make it smaaller</li>
        <li><b>Latency hiding</b>: Xlib requests requiring a reply are
	effectively synchronous: they block until the reply appears,
	whether the result is needed immediately or not.</li>
	<li><b>Direct access to the protocol</b>: Xlib does quite a
	bit of caching, layering, and similar optimizations. While this
	is normally a feature, it makes it difficult to simply emit
	specified X protocol requests and process specific
	responses.</li>
	<li><b>Threaded applications</b>: While Xlib does attempt to
	support multithreading, the API makes this difficult and
	error-prone.</li>
	<li><b>New extensions</b>: The Xlib infrastructure provides
	limited support for the new creation of X extension client side
	code.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      For these reasons, among others, XCB, an X C binding, has been
      designed to solve the above problems and thus provide a base for
      <ul>
        <li>Toolkit implementation.</li>
	<li>Direct protocol-level programming.</li>
	<li>Lightweight emulation of commonly used portions of the
	Xlib API (in progress)</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <li class="title"><a name="Xmodel">The client and server model of the X window system</a></li>
      <p>
      The X Window System was developed with one major goal:
      flexibility. The idea was that the way things look is one thing,
      but the way things work is another matter. Thus, the lower
      levels provide the tools required to draw windows, handle user
      input, allow drawing graphics using colors (or black and white
      screens), etc. To this point, a decision was made to separate
      the system into two parts. A client that decides what to do, and
      a server that actually draws on the screen and reads user input
      in order to send it to the client for processing.
      </p>
      <p>
      This model is the complete opposite of what is used to when
      dealing with clients and servers. In our case, the user seats
      near the machine controlled by the server, while the client
      might be running on a remote machine. The server controls the
      screens, mouse and keyboard. A client may connect to the server,
      request that it draws a window (or several windows), and ask the
      server to send it any input the user sends to these
      windows. Thus, several clients may connect to a single X server
      (one might be running an mail software, one running a WWW
      browser, etc). When input is sent by the user to some window,
      the server sends a message to the client controlling this window
      for processing. The client decides what to do with this input,
      and sends the server requests for drawing in the window.
      </p>
      <p>
      The whole session is carried out using the X message
      protocol. This protocol was originally carried over the TCP/IP
      protocol suite, allowing the client to run on any machine
      connected to the same network that the server is. Later on, the
      X servers were extended to allow clients running on the local
      machine with more optimized access to the server (note that an X
      protocol message may be several hundreds of KB in size), such as
      using shred memory, or using Unix domain sockets (a method for
      creating a logical channel on a Unix system between two processors).
      </p>
      <li class="title"><a name="asynch">GUI programming: the asynchronous model</a></li>
      <p>
      Unlike conventional computer programs, that carry some serial
      nature, a GUI program usually uses an asynchronous programming
      model, also known as "event-driven programming". This means that
      that program mostly sits idle, waiting for events sent by the X
      server, and then acts upon these events. An event may say "The
      user pressed the 1st button mouse in spot (x,y)", or "The window
      you control needs to be redrawn". In order for the program to e
      responsive to the user input, as well as to refresh requests, it
      needs to handle each event in a rather short period of time
      (e.g. less that 200 milliseconds, as a rule of thumb).
      </p>
      <p>
      This also implies that the program may not perform operations
      that might take a long time while handling an event (such as
      opening a network connection to some remote server, or
      connecting to a database server, or even performing a long file
      copy operation). Instead, it needs to perform all these
      operations in an asynchronous manner. This may be done by using
      various asynchronous models to perform the longish operations,
      or by performing them in a different process or thread.
      </p>
      <p>
      So the way a GUI program looks is something like that:
      <ol>
        <li>Perform initialization routines.</li>
	<li>Connect to the X server.</li>
	<li>Perform X-related initialization.</li>
	<li>While not finished:</li>
	  <ol>
  	    <li>Receive the next event from the X server.</li>
	    <li>Handle the event, possibly sending various drawing
	    requests to the X server.</li>
	    <li>If the event was a quit message, exit the loop.</li>
	  </ol>
	<li>Close down the connection to the X server. </li>
	<li>Perform cleanup operations.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <li class="title"><a name="notions">Basic XCB notions</a></li>
      <p>
      XCB has been created to eliminate the needs of
      programs to actually implement the X protocol layer. This
      library gives a program a very low-level access to any X
      server. Since the protocol is standardized, a client using any
      implementation of XCB may talk with any X server (the same
      occurs for Xlib, of course). We now give a brief description of
      the basic XCB notions. They will be detailed later.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="conn">The X Connection</a></li>
	<p>
	The major notion of using XCB is the X Connection. This is a
	structure representing the connection we have open with a
	given X server. It hides a queue of messages coming from the
	server, and a queue of pending requests that our client
	intends to send to the server. In XCB, this structure is named
	'XCBConnection'. When we open a connection to an X server, the
	library returns a pointer to such a structure. Later, we
	supply this pointer to any XCB function that should send
	messages to the X server or receive messages from this server.
	</p>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="gc">The Graphic Context</a></li>
	<p>
	When we perform various drawing operations (graphics, text,
	etc), we may specify various options for controlling how the
	data will be drawn (what foreground and background colors to
	use, how line edges will be connected, what font to use when
	drawing some text, etc). In order to avoid the need to supply
	hundreds of parameters to each drawing function, a graphical
	context structure is used. We set the various drawing options
	in this structure, and then, we pass a pointer to this
	structure to any drawing routines. This is rather handy, as we
	often need to perform several drawing requests with the same
	options. Thus, we would initialize a graphical context, set
	the desired options, and pass this structure to all drawing
	functions.
	</p>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="events">Events</a></li>
	<p>
	A structure is used to pass events received from the X
	server. XCB supports a large amount of event types (33 when
	this tutorial was written). This structure contains the type
	of event received, as well as the data associated with the
	event (e.g. position on the screen where the event was
	generated, mouse button associated with the event, region of
	the screen associated with a "redraw" event, etc). The way to
	read the event's data epends on the event type.
	</p>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
      <li class="title"><a name="use">Using XCB-based programs</a></li>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="inst">Installation of XCB</a></li>
	<p>
	To build XCB from source, you need to have installed at
	least:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>pkgconfig 0.15.0</li>
	  <li>automake 1.7</li>
	  <li>autoconf 2.50</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.check.org">check</a></li>
	  <li><a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">xsltproc</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	You have to checkout in CVS the following modules:
	</p>
	<ul>
          <li>Xproto from xlibs</li>
	  <li>Xau from xlibs</li>
	  <li>xcb-proto</li>
	  <li>xcb</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Note that Xproto and xcb-proto exist only to install header
	files, so typing 'make' or 'make all' will produce the message
	"Nothing to be done for 'all'". That's normal.
	</p>
	<li class="subtitle"><a name="comp">Compiling XCB-based programs</a></li>
	<p>
	Compiling XCB-based programs requires linking them with the XCB
	library. This is easily done thanks to pkgconfig:
	</p>
	<pre class="text">
gcc prog.c -o prog `pkg-config --cflags --libs xcb`
</pre>
      </ol>
      <li class="title"><a name="openconn">Opening and closing the connection to an X server</a></li>
      <p>
      An X program first needs to open the connection to the X
      server. There is a function that opens a connection with default
      parameters (the display being the one in the environment
      variable DISPLAY):
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
XCBConnection *XCBConnectBasic (void);
</pre>
      <p>
      The returned structure is given by
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
struct XCBConnection {
    /* constant data */
    XCBConnSetupSuccessRep *setup;
    int fd;

  c = XCBConnectBasic ();

  return 1;
}
</pre>
      <p>
      If you want ot open a connection with a specific display, you
      can use the function <span class="code">XCBConnect</span>, whose
      prototype is:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
XCBConnection *XCBConnect (int fd, XCBAuthInfo *auth_info);
</pre>
      <p>
      Here is how to use this function:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#include &lt;X11/XCB/xcb.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  XCBConnection *c;
  char          *display_name;
  char          *host;
  int            display;
  int            screen;
  int            fd;            /* The file descriptor */
  XCBAuthInfo    auth;          /* The authorization data */
  
  display_name = ":0.0";
  if (!XCBParseDisplay (0, &amp;host, &amp;display, &amp;screen))
    {
      printf ("Invalid DISPLAY\n");
      abort ();
    }

  fd = XCBOpen (host, display);
  free (host);
  if (fd == -1)
    {
      printf ("Error: XCBOpen\n");
      abort();
    }

  /* Open the connection to the X server */
  XCBGetAuthInfo (fd, &amp;auth);
  c = XCBConnect (fd, &amp;auth);

  free (auth.name);
  free (auth.data);

  return 1;
}
</pre>
      <p>
      Finally, to close a connection, it suffices to use:

      <li class="title"><a name="screen">Checking basic information about a connection</a></li>
      <p>
      Once we opened a connection to an X server, we should check some
      basic informations about it: what screens it has, what is the
      size (width and height) of the screen, how many colors it
      supports (black and white ? grey scale ?, 256 colors ? more ?),
      and so on. We get such informations from the XCBSCREEN
      structure:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    XCBWINDOW root;
    XCBCOLORMAP default_colormap;

    BOOL save_unders;
    CARD8 root_depth;
    CARD8 allowed_depths_len;
} XCBSCREEN;
</pre>
      <p>
      We could retrieve the first screen of the connection by using the
      following function:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
XCBSCREENIter XCBConnSetupSuccessRepRootsIter (XCBConnSetupSuccessRep *R);
</pre>
      <p>
      Here is a small program that shows how to use this function:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  /* Open the connection to the X server */
  c = XCBConnectBasic ();
  
  /* Get the first screen */
  screen = XCBConnSetupSuccessRepRootsIter (XCBGetSetup (c)).data;

  printf ("\n");
  printf ("Informations of screen %ld:\n", screen-&gt;root.xid);

      <li class="title"><a name="helloworld">Creating a basic window - the "hello world" program</a></li>
      <p>
      After we got some basic informations about our screen, we can
      create our first window. In the X Window System, a window is
      characterized by an Id. So, in XCB, a window is of type:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    CARD32 xid;
} XCBWINDOW;
</pre>
      <p>
      We first ask the X server to give an Id to our window, with this
      function:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
XCBWINDOW XCBWINDOWNew(XCBConnection *c);
</pre>
      <p>
      Then, XCB supplies the following function to create new windows:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBCreateWindow (XCBConnection *c,             /* Pointer to the XCBConnection structure */
                               CARD8          depth,         /* Depth of the screen */
                               XCBWINDOW      wid,           /* Id of the window */
			       XCBWINDOW      parent,        /* Id of an existing window that should be the parent of the new window */
			       INT16          x,             /* X position of the top-left corner of the window (in pixels) */
			       INT16          y,             /* Y position of the top-left corner of the window (in pixels) */
		       	       CARD16         width,         /* Width of the window (in pixels) */
			       CARD16         height,        /* Height of the window (in pixels) */
			       CARD16         border_width,  /* Width of the window's border (in pixels) */
			       CARD16         _class,
			       XCBVISUALID    visual,
			       CARD32         value_mask,
			       const CARD32  *value_list);
</pre>
      <p>
      The fact that we created the window does not mean that it will
      be drawn on screen. By default, newly created windows are not
      mapped on the screen (they are invisible). In order to make our
      window visible, we use the function <span class="code">XCBMapWindow()</span>, whose
      prototype is
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBMapWindow (XCBConnection *c, XCBWINDOW window);
</pre>
      <p>
      Finally, here is a small program to create a window of size
      150x150 pixels, positioned at the top-left corner of the screen:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
#include &lt;X11/XCB/xcb.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  XCBConnection *c;
  XCBSCREEN     *screen;
  XCBDRAWABLE    win;
  
  /* Open the connection to the X server */
  c = XCBConnectBasic ();
  
  /* Get the first screen */
  screen = XCBConnSetupSuccessRepRootsIter (XCBGetSetup (c)).data;

  /* Ask for our window's Id */
  win.window = XCBWINDOWNew(c);

  /* Create the window */
  XCBCreateWindow (c,                        /* Connection          */
 		   0,                        /* depth               */
		   win.window,               /* window Id           */
		   screen-&gt;root,             /* parent window       */
		   0, 0,                     /* x, y                */
		   150, 150,                 /* width, height       */
		   10,                       /* border_width        */

		   screen-&gt;root_visual,      /* visual              */
		   0, NULL);                 /* masks, not used yet */

  /* Map the window on the screen */
  XCBMapWindow (c, win.window);

  XCBSync (c, 0);
  
  while (1) {}

  return 1;
}
</pre>
      <p>
      In this code, you see one more function - <span class="code">XCBSync()</span>, not explained
      yet. It is used to flush all the pending requests. More
      precisely, there are 2 functions that do such things. The first
      one is <span class="code">XCBFlush()</span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
int XCBFlush (XCBConnection *c);
</pre>
      <p>
      This function flushes all pending requests to the X server (much
      like the <span class="code">fflush()</span> function is used to
      flush standard output). The second function is 
      <span class="code">XCBSync()</span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
int XCBSync(XCBConnection *c, XCBGenericError **e);
</pre>
      <p>
      This functions also flushes all pending requests to the X
      server, and then waits until the X server finishing processing
      these requests. In a normal program, this will not be necessary
      (we'll see why when we get to write a normal X program), but for
      now, we put it there. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The window that is created by the above code has a default
      background (gray). This one can be set to a specific color,
      thanks to the two last parameters of
      <span class="code">XCBCreateWindow()</span>, which are not
      described yet. See the subsections
      <a href="#winconf">Configuring a window</a> or
      <a href="#winconf">Registering for event types using event masks</a>
      for exemples on how to use these parameters. In addition, as no
      events are handled, you have to make a Ctrl-C to interrupt the
      program.

      <p>
      Drawing in a window can be done using various graphical
      functions (drawing pixels, lines, rectangles, etc). In order to
      draw in a window, we first need to define various general
      drawing parameters (what line width to use, which color to draw
      with, etc). This is done using a graphical context.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="allocgc">Allocating a Graphics Context</a></li>
        <p>
	As we said, a graphical context defines several attributes to
	be used with the various drawing functions. For this, we
	define a graphical context. We can use more than one graphical
	context with a single window, in order to draw in multiple
	styles (different colors, different line widths, etc). In XCB,
	a Graphics Context is, as a window, characterized by an Id:
        </p>
	<pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    CARD32 xid;
} XCBGCONTEXT;
</pre>
        <p>
        We first ask the X server to attribute an Id to our graphic
	context with this function:
        </p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBGCONTEXT XCBGCONTEXTNew (XCBConnection *c);
</pre>
        <p>
        Then, we set the attributes of the graphic context with this function:
        </p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBCreateGC (XCBConnection *c,
                           XCBGCONTEXT    cid,
			   XCBDRAWABLE    drawable,
			   CARD32         value_mask,
			   const CARD32  *value_list);
</pre>
        <p>
	We give now an example on how to allocate a graphic context
	that specifies that each drawing functions that use it will
	draw in foreground with a black color.
        </p>		   
        <pre class="code">
#include &lt;X11/XCB/xcb.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  XCBConnection *c;
  XCBSCREEN     *screen;
  XCBDRAWABLE    win;
  XCBGCONTEXT    black;
  CARD32         mask;
  CARD32         value[1];
  
  /* Open the connection to the X server and get the first screen */
  c = XCBConnectBasic ();
  screen = XCBConnSetupSuccessRepRootsIter (XCBGetSetup (c)).data;

  /* Create a black graphic context for drawing in the foreground */
  win.window = screen-&gt;root;
  black = XCBGCONTEXTNew (c);
  mask = GCForeground;
  value[0] = screen-&gt;black_pixel;
  XCBCreateGC (c, black, win, mask, value);

  return 1;
}
</pre>
        <p>
        Note should be taken regarding the role of "value_mask" and
	"value_list" in the prototype of <span class="code">XCBCreateGC()</span>. Since a 
	graphic context has many attributes, and since we often just
	want to define a few of them, we need to be able to tell the
	<span class="code">XCBCreateGC()</span> which attributes we
	want to set. This is what the "value_mask" parameter is
	for. We then use the "value_list" parameter to specify actual
	values for the attribute we defined in "value_mask". Thus, for
	each constant used in "value_list", we will use the matching
	constant in "value_mask". In this case, we define a graphic
	context with one attribute: when drawing (a point, a line,
	etc), the foreground color will be black. The rest of the
	attributes of this graphic context will be set to their
	default values.

        <p>
	Once we have allocated a Graphic Context, we may need to
	change its attributes (for example, changing the foreground
	color we use to draw a line, or changing the attributes of the
	font we use to display strings. See Subsections Drawing with a
	color and Assigning a Font to a Graphic Context). This is done
	by using this function:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBChangeGC (XCBConnection *c,           /* The XCB Connection */
                           XCBGCONTEXT    gc,          /* The Graphic Context */
			   CARD32         value_mask,  /* Components of the Graphic Context that have to be set */
			   const CARD32  *value_list); /* Value as specified by value_mask */
</pre>
        <p>
	The <span class="code">value_mask</span> parameter could take
	these values:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>GCFunction</li>
	  <li>GCPlaneMask</li>
	  <li>GCForeground</li>

	</ul>
	<p>
	It is possible to set several attributes at the same
	time (for example setting the attributes of a font and the
	color which will be used to display a string), by OR'ing these
	values in <span class="code">value_mask</span>. Then
	<span class="code">value_list</span> has to be an array which

	After we have created a Graphic Context, we can draw on a

      <li class="title"><a name="xevents">X Events</a></li>
      <p>
      In an X program, everything is driven by events. Event painting
      on the screen is sometimes done as a response to an event (an
      <span class="code">Expose</span> event). If part of a program's
      window that was hidden, gets exposed (e.g. the window was raised
      above other widows), the X server will send an "expose" event to
      let the program know it should repaint that part of the
      window. User input (key presses, mouse movement, etc) is also
      received as a set of events.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="register">Registering for event types using event masks</a></li>
	<p>
	During the creation of a window, you should give it what kind
	of events it wishes to receive. Thus, you may register for
	various mouse (also called pointer) events, keyboard events,
	expose events, and so on. This is done for optimizing the
	server-to-client connection (i.e. why send a program (that
	might even be running at the other side of the globe) an event
	it is not interested in ?)
	</p>
	<p>
	In XCB, you use the "value_mask" and "value_list" data in the
	<span class="code">XCBCreateWindow()</span> function to
	register for events. Here is how we register for
	<span class="code">Expose</span> event when creating a window:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
  mask = XCBCWEventMask;
  valwin[0] = ExposureMask;
  win.window = XCBWINDOWNew (c);
  XCBCreateWindow (c, depth, win.window, root-&gt;root,
		   0, 0, 150, 150, 10,
		   InputOutput, root-&gt;root_visual,
		   mask, valwin);
</pre>
        <p>
	<span class="code">ExposureMask</span> is a constant defined
	in the "X.h" header file. If we wanted to register to several
	event types, we can logically "or" them, as follows:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
  mask = XCBCWEventMask;
  valwin[0] = ExposureMask | ButtonPressMask;
  win.window = XCBWINDOWNew (c);
  XCBCreateWindow (c, depth, win.window, root-&gt;root,
		   0, 0, 150, 150, 10,
		   InputOutput, root-&gt;root_visual,
		   mask, valwin);
</pre>
	<p>
	This registers for <span class="code">Expose</span> events as
	well as for mouse button presses insode the created
	window. You should note that a mask may represent several
	event sub-types.
	</p>
	<p>
	The values that a mask could take are given
	by the <span class="code">XCBCW</span> enumeration:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
typedef enum {
    XCBCWBackPixmap       = 1L<<0,
    XCBCWBackPixel        = 1L<<1,
    XCBCWBorderPixmap     = 1L<<2,
    XCBCWBorderPixel      = 1L<<3,
    XCBCWBitGravity       = 1L<<4,
    XCBCWWinGravity       = 1L<<5,
    XCBCWBackingStore     = 1L<<6,
    XCBCWBackingPlanes    = 1L<<7,
    XCBCWBackingPixel     = 1L<<8,
    XCBCWOverrideRedirect = 1L<<9,
    XCBCWSaveUnder        = 1L<<10,
    XCBCWEventMask        = 1L<<11,
    XCBCWDontPropagate    = 1L<<12,
    XCBCWColormap         = 1L<<13,
    XCBCWCursor           = 1L<<14
} XCBCW;
</pre>
	<div class="emph">
        <p>Note: we must be careful when setting the values of the valwin
        parameter, as they have to follow the order the
	<span class="code">XCBCW</span> enumeration. Here is an
        example:
	</p>
	</div>
	<pre class="code">
  mask = XCBCWEventMask | XCBCWBackPixmap;
  valwin[0] = None;                           /* for XCBCWBackPixmap (whose value is 1)    */
  valwin[1] = ExposureMask | ButtonPressMask; /* for XCBCWEventMask, whose value (2048)    */
                                              /* is superior to the one of XCBCWBackPixmap */
</pre>
	<p>
	If the window has already been created, we can use the
	<span class="code">XCBConfigureWindow()</span> function to set
	the events that the window will receive. The subsection
	<a href="#winconf">Configuring a window</a> shows its
	prototype. As an example, here is a piece of code that
	configures the window to receive the
	<span class="code">Expose</span> and
	<span class="code">ButtonPressMask</span> events:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
const static CARD32 values[] = { ExposureMask | ButtonPressMask };

/* The connection c and the window win are supposed to be defined */

XCBConfigureWindow (c, win, XCBCWEventMask, values);
</pre>
	<div class="emph">
	<p>
	Note: A common bug programmers do is adding code to handle new
	event types in their program, while forgetting to add the
	masks for these events in the creation of the window. Such a
	programmer then should sit down for hours debugging his
	program, wondering "Why doesn't my program notice that I
	released the button?", only to find that they registered for
	button press events but not for button release events.
	</p>
	</div>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="loop">Receiving events: writing the events loop</a></li>
	<p>
	After we have registered for the event types we are interested
	in, we need to enter a loop of receiving events and handling
	them. There are two ways to receive events: a blocking way and
	a non blocking way:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	  <span class="code">XCBWaitEvent (XCBConnection *c)</span>
	  is the blocking way. It waits (so blocks...) until an event is
	  queued in the X server. Then it retrieves it into a newly
	  allocated structure (it dequeues it from the queue) and returns
	  it. This structure has to be freed. The function returns
	  <span class="code">NULL</span> if an error occurs.
	  </li>
	  <br />
	  <li>
	  <span class="code">XCBPollForEvent (XCBConnection *c, int
	  *error)</span> is the non blocking way. It looks at the event
	  queue and returns (and dequeues too) an existing event into
	  a newly allocated structure. This structure has to be
	  freed. It returns <span class="code">NULL</span> if there is
	  no event. If an error occurs, the parameter <span
	  class="code">error</span> will be filled with the error
	  status.
	  </li> 
	</ul>
	<p>
	There are various ways to write such a loop. We present two
	ways to write such a loop, with the two functions above. The
	first one uses <span class="code">XCBWaitEvent</span>, which
	is similar to an event Xlib loop using only <span
	class="code">XNextEvent</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
  XCBGenericEvent *e;

  while ((e = XCBWaitEvent (c)))
    {
      switch (e-&gt;response_type)
	{
	case XCBExpose:
	  {
	    /* Handle the Expose event type */
	    XCBExposeEvent *ev = (XCBExposeEvent *)e;

	    /* ... */

	    break;
	  }
	case XCBButtonPress: 
	  {
	    /* Handle the ButtonPress event type */
	    XCBButtonPressEvent *ev = (XCBButtonPressEvent *)e;

	    /* ... */

	    break;
	  }
	default:
	  {
	    /* Unknown event type, ignore it */
	    break;
	  }
	}
      /* Free the Generic Event */
      free (e);
    }
</pre>
	<p>
	You will certainly want to use <span
	class="code">XCBPollForEvent(XCBConnection *c, int
	*error)</span> if, in Xlib, you use <span
	class="code">XPending</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
  while (XPending (display))
    {
      XEvent ev;

      XNextEvent(d, &ev);
      
      /* Manage your event */
    }
</pre>
        <p>
	Such a loop in XCB looks like:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
  XCBGenericEvent *ev;

  while ((ev = XCBPollForEvent (conn, 0)))
    {
      /* Manage your event */
    }
</pre>
	<p>
	The events are managed in the same way as with <span
	class="code">XCBWaitEvent</span>.
	Obviously, we will need to give the user some way of
	terminating the program. This is usually done by handling a
	special "quit" event, as we will soon see.

        <li class="subtitle"><a name="expose">Expose events</a></li>
	<p>
	The <span class="code">Expose</span> event is one of the most
	basic (and most used) events an application may receive. It
	will be sent to us in one of several cases:
	  <ul>
  	    <li>A window that covered part of our window has moved
	    away, exposing part (or all) of our window.</li>
	    <li>Our window was raised above other windows.</li>
	    <li>Our window mapped for the first time.</li>
	    <li>Our window was de-iconified.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	You should note the implicit assumption hidden here: the
	contents of our window is lost when it is being obscured
	(covered) by either windows. One may wonder why the X server
	does not save this contents. The answer is: to save
	memory. After all, the number of windows on a display at a
	given time may be very large, and storing the contents of all
	of them might require a lot of memory. Actually, there is a
	way to tell the X server to store  the contents of a window in
	special cases, as we will see later.
	</p>
	<p>
	When we get an <span class="code">Expose</span> event, we
	should take the event's data from the members of the following
	structure:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    BYTE response_type;  /* The type of the event, here it is XCBExpose */
    CARD8 pad0;
    CARD16 sequence;
    XCBWINDOW window;    /* The Id of the window that receives the event (in case */
                         /* our application registered for events on several windows */
    CARD16 x;            /* The x coordinate of the top-left part of the window that needs to be redrawn */
    CARD16 y;            /* The y coordinate of the top-left part of the window that needs to be redrawn */
    CARD16 width;        /* The width of the part of the window that needs to be redrawn */
    CARD16 height;       /* The height of the part of the window that needs to be redrawn */
    CARD16 count;
} XCBExposeEvent;
</pre>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="userinput">Getting user input</a></li>
	<p>
	User input traditionally comes from two sources: the mouse
	and the keyboard. Various event types exist to notify us of
	user input (a key being presses on the keyboard, a key being
	released on the keyboard, the mouse moving over our window,
	the mouse entering (or leaving) our window, and so on.
	</p>
	<ol>
  	  <li class="subsubtitle"><a name="mousepressrelease">Mouse button press and release events</a></li>
	  <p>
	  The first event type we will deal with is a mouse
	  button-press (or button-release) event in our window. In
	  order to register to such an event type, we should add one
	  (or more) of the following masks when we create our window:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="code">ButtonPressMask</span>: notify us
	    of any button that was pressed in one of our windows.</li>
	    <li><span class="code">ButtonReleaseMask</span>: notify us
	    of any button that was released in one of our windows.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	  The structure to be checked for in our events loop is the
	  same for these two events, and is the following:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    BYTE response_type;  /* The type of the event, here it is XCBButtonPressEvent or XCBButtonReleaseEvent */
    XCBBUTTON detail;

    INT16 event_x;       /* The x coordinate where the mouse has been pressed in the window */
    INT16 event_y;       /* The y coordinate where the mouse has been pressed in the window */
    CARD16 state;        /* A mask of the buttons (or keys) during the event */
    BOOL same_screen;
} XCBButtonPressEvent;

typedef XCBButtonPressEvent XCBButtonReleaseEvent;
</pre>
          <p>
	  The <span class="code">time</span> field may be used to calculate "double-click"
	  situations by an application (e.g. if the mouse button was
	  clicked two times in a duration shorter than a given amount
	  of time, assume this was a double click).
	  </p>
          <p>
	  The <span class="code">state</span> field is a mask of the buttons held down during
	  the event. It is a bitwise OR of any of the following:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="code">Button1Mask</span></li>
	    <li><span class="code">Button2Mask</span></li>
	    <li><span class="code">Button3Mask</span></li>

	    <li><span class="code">Mod5Mask</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	  Their names are self explanatory, where the first 5 refer to
	  the mouse buttons that are being pressed, while the rest
	  refer to various "special keys" that are being pressed (Mod1
	  is usually the 'Alt' key or the 'Meta' key).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  <b>TODO:</b> Problem: it seems that the state does not
	  change when clicking with various buttons.

  	  <li class="subsubtitle"><a name="mousemvnt">Mouse movement events</a></li>
	  <p> 
	  Similar to mouse button press and release events, we also
	  can be notified of various mouse movement events. These can
	  be split into two families. One is of mouse pointer
	  movement while no buttons are pressed, and the second is a
	  mouse pointer motion while one (or more) of the buttons are
	  pressed (this is sometimes called "a mouse drag operation",
	  or just "dragging"). The following event masks may be added
	  during the creation of our window:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="code">PointerMotionMask</span>: events of
	    the pointer moving in one of the windows controlled by our
	    application, while no mouse button is held pressed.</li>
	    <li><span class="code">ButtonMotionMask</span>: Events of
	    the pointer moving while one or more of the mouse buttons
	    is held pressed.</li>
	    <li><span class="code">Button1MotionMask</span>: same as
	    <span class="code">ButtonMotionMask</span>, but only when
	    the 1st mouse button is held pressed.</li>
	    <li><span class="code">Button2MotionMask</span>,
	    <span class="code">Button3MotionMask</span>,
	    <span class="code">Button4MotionMask</span>,
	    <span class="code">Button5MotionMask</span>: same as
	    <span class="code">Button1MotionMask</span>, but
	    respectively for 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th mouse button.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	  The structure to be checked for in our events loop is the
	  same for these events, and is the following:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="code">

	  Another type of event that applications might be interested
	  at, is a mouse pointer entering a window the program
	  controls, or leaving such a window. Some programs use these
	  events to show the user tht the applications is now in
	  focus. In order to register for such an event type, we
	  should add one (or more) of the following masks when we

	  <p>
	  There may be many windows on a screen, but only a single
	  keyboard attached to them. How does the X server then know
	  which window should be sent a given keyboard input ? This is
	  done using the keyboard focus. Only a single window on the
	  screen may have the keyboard focus at a given time. There
	  is a XCB function that allow a program to set the keyboard
	  focus to a given window. The user can usually set the
	  keyboard ficus using the window manager (often by clicking
	  on the title bar of the desired window). Once our window
	  has the keyboard focus, every key press or key release will
	  cause an event to be sent to our program (if it regsitered
	  for these event types...).
	  </p>
  	  <li class="subsubtitle"><a name="keypress">Keyboard press and release events</a></li>
	  <p>
	  If a window controlled by our program currently holds the
	  keyboard focus, it can receive key press and key release
	  events. So, we should add one (or more) of the following
	  masks when we create our window:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="code">KeyPressMask</span>: notify us when
	    a key was pressed while any of our controlled windows had
	    the keyboard focus.</li>
	    <li><span class="code">KeyReleaseMask</span>: notify us
	    when a key was released while any of our controlled
	    windows had the keyboard focus.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	  The structure to be checked for in our events loop is the
	  same for these two events, and is the following:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="code">

      <li class="title"><a name="font">Handling text and fonts</a></li>
      <p>
      Besides drawing graphics on a window, we often want to draw
      text. Text strings have two major properties: the characters to
      be drawn and the font with which they are drawn. In order to
      draw text, we need to first request the X server to load a
      font. We the assign a font to a Graphic Context, and finally, we
      draw the text in a window, using the Graphic Context.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="fontstruct">The Font structure</a></li>
	<p>
	In order to support flexible fonts, a font structure is
	defined. You know what ? Its an Id:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    CARD32 xid;
} XCBFONT;
</pre>
	<p>
	It is used to contain information about a font, and is passed
	to several functions that handle fonts selection and text drawing.

      </ol>
      <li class="title"><a name="wm">Interacting with the window manager</a></li>
      <p>
      After we have seen how to create windows and draw on them, we
      take one step back, and look at how our windows are interacting
      with their environment (the full screen and the other
      windows). First of all, our application needs to interact with
      the window manager. The window manager is responsible to
      decorating drawn windows (i.e. adding a frame, an iconify
      button, a system menu, a title bar, etc), as well as handling
      icons shown when windows are being iconified. It also handles
      ordering of windows on the screen, and other administrative
      tasks. We need to give it various hints as to how we want it to
      treat our application's windows.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="wmprop">Window properties</a></li>
	<p>
	Many of the parameters communicated to the window manager are
	passed using data called "properties". These properties are
	attached by the X server to different windows, and are stores
	in a format that makes it possible to read them from different
	machines that may use different architectures (remember that
	an X client program may run on a remote machine).
	</p>
	<p>
	The property and its type (a string, an integer, etc) are
	Id. Their type are <span class="code">XCBATOM</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    CARD32 xid;
} XCBATOM;
</pre>
	<p>
	To change the property of a window, we use the following
	function:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBChangeProperty (XCBConnection *c,  /* Connection to the X server */
                                 CARD8 mode,        /* Property mode */
				 XCBWINDOW window,  /* Window */
				 XCBATOM property,  /* Property to change */
				 XCBATOM type,      /* Type of the property */
				 CARD8 format,      /* Format of the property (8, 16, 32) */
				 CARD32 data_len,   /* Length of the data parameter */
				 const void *data); /* Data */
</pre>
	<p>
	The <span class="code">mode</span> parameter coud be one of
	the following value (defined in the X.h header file):
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>PropModeReplace</li>
	  <li>PropModePrepend</li>
	  <li>PropModeAppend</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="wmname">Setting the window name and icon name</a></li>
	<p>
	The firt thing we want to do would be to set the name for our
	window. This is done using the
	<span class="code">XCBChangeProperty()</span> function. This
	name may be used by the window manager as the title of the
	window (in the title bar), in a task list, etc. The property
	atom to use to set the name of a window is

      <li class="title"><a name="winop">Simple window operations</a></li>
      <p>
      One more thing we can do to our window is manipulate them on the
      screen (resize them, move them, raise or lower them, iconify
      them, and so on). Some window operations functions are supplied
      by XCB for this purpose.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="winmap">Mapping and un-mapping a window</a></li>
	<p>
	The first pair of operations we can apply on a window is
	mapping it, or un-mapping it. Mapping a window causes the
	window to appear on the screen, as we have seen in our simple
	window program example. Un-mapping it causes it to be removed
	from the screen (although the window as a logical entity still
	exists). This gives the effect of making a window hidden
	(unmapped) and shown again (mapped). For example, if we have a
	dialog box window in our program, instead of creating it every
	time the user asks to open it, we can create the window once,
	in an un-mapped mode, and when the user asks to open it, we
	simply map the window on the screen. When the user clicked the
	'OK' or 'Cancel' button, we simply un-map the window. This is
	much faster than creating and destroying the window, however,
	the cost is wasted resources, both on the client side, and on
	the X server side.
	</p>
	<p>
	To map a window, you use the following function:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBMapWindow(XCBConnection *c, XCBWINDOW window);
</pre>
        <p>
	To have a simple example, see the <a href="#helloworld">example</a>
	above. The mapping operation will cause an
	<span class="code">Expose</span> event to be sent to our
	application, unless the window is completely covered by other
	windows.
	</p>
	<p>
	Un-mapping a window is also simple. You use the function
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBUnmapWindow(XCBConnection *c, XCBWINDOW window);
</pre>
	<p>
	The utilization of this function is the same as
	<span class="code">XCBMapWindow()</span>.
	</p>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="winconf">Configuring a window</a></li>
	<p>
	As we have seen when we have created our first window, in the
	X Events subsection, we can set some attributes to the window
	(that is, the position, the size, the events the window will
	receive, etc). If we want to modify them, but the window is
	already created, we can change them by using hte following
	function:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBConfigureWindow (XCBConnection *c,            /* The connection to the X server*/
                                  XCBWINDOW      window,       /* The window to configure */
				  CARD16         value_mask,   /* The mask */
				  const CARD32  *value_list);  /* The values to set */
</pre>
        <p>
	We set the <span class="code">value_mask</span> to one or
	several mask values that are in the X.h header:
	<ul>
 	  <li><span class="code">CWX</span>: new x coordinate of the window's top left corner</li>
	  <li><span class="code">CWY</span>: new y coordinate of the window's top left corner</li>
	  <li><span class="code">CWWidth</span>: new width of the window</li>
	  <li><span class="code">CWHeight</span>: new height of the window</li>
	  <li><span class="code">CWBorderWidth</span>: new width of the border of the window</li>
	  <li><span class="code">CWSibling</span></li>
	  <li><span class="code">CWStackMode</span>: the new stacking order</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	We then give to <span class="code">value_mask</span> the new
	value. We now describe how to use
	<span class="code">XCBConfigureWindow</span> in some useful
	situations.
	</p>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="winmove">Moving a window around the screen</a></li>
	<p>
	An operation we might want to do with windows is to move them
	to a different location. This can be done like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
const static CARD32 values[] = { 10, 20 };

/* The connection c and the window win are supposed to be defined */

/* Move the window to coordinates x = 10 and y = 20 */
XCBConfigureWindow (c, win, CWX | CWY, values);
</pre>
	<p>
	Note that when the window is moved, it might get partially
	exposed or partially hidden by other windows, and thus we
	might get <span class="code">Expose</span> events due to this

	Until now, we changed properties of a single window. We'll see

	windows. One of hem is the stacking order. That is, the order
	in which the windows are layered on top of each other. The
	front-most window is said to be on the top of the stack, while
	the back-most window is at the bottom of the stack. Here is
	how to manipulate our windows stack order:

	Just like we can set various attributes of our windows, we can

	One problem is that the returned location of the window is
	relative to its parent window. This makes these coordinates
	rather useless for any window manipulation functions, like
	moving it on the screen. In order to overcome this problem, we
	need to take a two-step operation. First, we find out the Id
	of the parent window of our window. We then translate the
	above relative coordinates to the screen coordinates.

      <li class="title"><a name="usecolor">Using colors to paint the rainbow</a></li>
      <p>
      Up until now, all our painting operation were done using black
      and white. We will (finally) see now how to draw using colors.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="colormap">Color maps</a></li>
	<p>
	In the beginning, there were not enough colors. Screen
	controllers could only support a limited number of colors
	simultaneously (initially 2, then 4, 16 and 256). Because of
	this, an application could not just ask to draw in a "light
	purple-red" color, and expect that color to be available. Each
	application allocated the colors it needed, and when all the
	color entries (4, 16, 256 colors) were in use, the next color
	allocation would fail.
	</p>      
	<p>
	Thus, the notion of "a color map" was introduced. A color map
	is a table whose size is the same as the number of
	simultaneous colors a given screen controller. Each entry
	contained the RGB (Red, Green and Blue) values of a different
	color (all colors can be drawn using some combination of red,
	green and blue). When an application wants to draw on the
	screen, it does not specify which color to use. Rather, it
	specifies which color entry of some color map to be used
	during this drawing. Change the value in this color map entry
	and the drawing will use a different color.
	</p>
	<p>
	In order to be able to draw using colors that got something to
	do with what the programmer intended, color map allocation
	functions are supplied. You could ask to allocate entry for a
	color with a set of RGB values. If one already existed, you
	would get its index in the table. If none existed, and the
	table was not full, a new cell would be allocated to contain
	the given RGB values, and its index returned. If the table was
	full, the procedure would fail. You could then ask to get a
	color map entry with a color that is closest to the one you
	were asking for. This would mean that the actual drawing on
	the screen would be done using colors similar to what you
	wanted, but not the same.
	</p>
	<p>
	On today's more modern screens where one runs an X server with
	support for 16 million colors, this limitation looks a little
	silly, but remember that there are still older computers with
	older graphics cards out there. Using color map, support for
	these screen becomes transparent to you. On a display
	supporting 16 million colors, any color entry allocation
	request would succeed. On a display supporting a limited
	number of colors, some color allocation requests would return
	similar colors. It won't look as good, but your application
	would still work.
	</p>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="colormapalloc">Allocating and freeing Color Maps</a></li>
	<p>
	When you draw using XCB, you can choose to use the standard
	color map of the screen your window is displayed on, or you
	can allocate a new color map and apply it to a window. In the
	latter case, each time the mouse moves onto your window, the
	screen color map will be replaced by your window's color map,
	and you'll see all the other windows on screen change their
	colors into something quite bizzare. In fact, this is the
	effect you get with X applications that use the "-install"
	command line option.
	</p>
	<p>
	In XCB, a color map is (as often in X) an Id:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    CARD32 xid;
} XCBCOLORMAP;
</pre>
	<p>
	In order to access the screen's default color map, you just
	have to retrieve the <span class="code">default_colormap</span> 
	field of the <span class="code">XCBSCREEN</span> structure
	(see Section
	<a href="#screen">Checking basic information about a connection</a>):
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  XCBConnection *c;
  XCBSCREEN     *screen;
  XCBCOLORMAP    colormap;
  
  /* Open the connection to the X server and get the first screen */
  c = XCBConnectBasic ();
  screen = XCBConnSetupSuccessRepRootsIter (XCBGetSetup (c)).data;

  colormap = screen-&gt;default_colormap;

  return 1;
}
</pre>
	<p>
	This will return the color map used by default on the first
	screen (again, remember that an X server may support several
	different screens, each of which might have its own resources).
	</p>
	<p>
	The other option, that of allocating a new colormap, works as
	follows.  We first ask the X server to give an Id to our color
	map, with this function:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBCOLORMAP XCBCOLORMAPNew (XCBConnection *c);
</pre>
	<p>
	Then, we create the color map with
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBCreateColormap (XCBConnection *c,       /* Pointer to the XCBConnection structure */
                                 BYTE           alloc,   /* Colormap entries to be allocated (AllocNone or AllocAll) */
				 XCBCOLORMAP    mid,     /* Id of the color map */
				 XCBWINDOW      window,  /* Window on whose screen the colormap will be created */
				 XCBVISUALID    visual); /* Id of the visual supported by the screen */
</pre>
	<p>
	Here is an example of creation of a new color map:

	<pre class="code">

  /* Open the connection to the X server and get the first screen */

  screen = XCBConnSetupSuccessRepRootsIter (XCBGetSetup (c)).data;

  /* We create the window win here*/

  XCBCreateColormap (c, AllocNone, cmap, win, screen-&gt;root_visual);

  return 1;
}

        <p>
	Note that the window parameter is only used to allow the X
	server to create the color map for the given screen. We can
	then use this color map for any window drawn on the same screen.
	</p>
	<p>
	To free  a color map, it suffices to use this function:

	<pre class="code">

      <li class="title"><a name="pixmaps">X Bitmaps and Pixmaps</a></li>
      <p>
      One thing many so-called "Multi-Media" applications need to od,
      is display images. In the X world, this is done using bitmaps
      and pixmaps. We have already seen some usage of them when
      setting an icon for our application. Lets study them further,
      and see how to draw these images inside a window, along side the
      simple graphics and text we have seen so far.
      </p>
      <p>
      One thing to note before delving further, is that XCB (nor Xlib)
      supplies no means of manipulating popular image formats, such as
      gif, png, jpeg or tiff. It is up to the programmer (or to higher
      level graphics libraries) to translate these image formats into
      formats that the X server is familiar with (x bitmaps and x
      pixmaps).
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="pixmapswhat">What is a X Bitmap ? An X Pixmap ?</a></li>
	<p>
	An X bitmap is a two-color image stored in a format specific
	to the X window system. When stored in a file, the bitmap data
	looks like a C source file. It contains variables defining the
	width and the height of the bitmap, an array containing the
	bit values of the bitmap (the size of the array is
	weight*height), and an optional hot-spot location (that will

	An X pixmap is a format used to stored images in the memory of
	an X server. This format can store both black and white images
	(such as x bitmaps) as well as color images. It is the only
	image format supported by the X protocol, and any image to be
	drawn on screen, should be first translated into this format.
	</p>
	<p>
	In actuality, an X pixmap can be thought of as a window that
	does not appear on the screen. Many graphics operations that
	work on windows, will also work on pixmaps. Indeed, the type
	of X pixmap in XCB is an Id like a window:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    CARD32 xid;
} XCBPIXMAP;
</pre>
	<p>
	In order to make the difference between a window and a pixmap,
	XCB introduces a drawable type, which is a <b>union</b>
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
typedef union {
    XCBWINDOW window;
    XCBPIXMAP pixmap;
} XCBDRAWABLE;
</pre>
        <p>
	in order to avoid confusion between a window and a pixmap.The
	operations that will work indifferently on a window or a pixmap
	will require a <span class="code">XCBDRAWABLE</span>
	</p>
	<div class="emph">
	<p>
	Remark: In Xlib, there is no specific difference between a
	<span class="code">Drawable</span>, a
	<span class="code">Pixmap</span> or a
	<span class="code">Window</span>: all are 32 bit long
	integer.
	</p>
	</div>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="pixmapscreate">Creating a pixmap</a></li>
	<p>
	Sometimes we want to create an un-initialized pixmap, so we
	can later draw into it. This is useful for image drawing
	programs (creating a new empty canvas will cause the creation
	of a new pixmap on which the drawing can be stored). It is
	also useful when reading various image formats: we load the
	image data into memory, create a pixmap on the server, and
	then draw the decoded image data onto that pixmap.
	</p>
	<p>
	To create a new pixmap, we first ask the X server to give an
	Id to our pixmap, with this function: 
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBPIXMAP XCBPIXMAPNew (XCBConnection *c);
</pre>
        <p>
	 Then, XCB supplies the following function to create new pixmaps:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBCreatePixmap (XCBConnection *c,         /* Pointer to the XCBConnection structure */
                               CARD8          depth,     /* Depth of the screen */
			       XCBPIXMAP      pid,       /* Id of the pixmap */
			       XCBDRAWABLE    drawable,
			       CARD16         width,     /* Width of the window (in pixels) */
			       CARD16         height);   /* Height of the window (in pixels) */
</pre>
        <p>
	<b>TODO</b>: Explain the drawable parameter, and give an
	example (like xpoints.c)
	</p>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="pixmapsdraw"></a>Drawing a pixmap in a window</li>
	<p>
	Once we got a handle to a pixmap, we can draw it on some
	window, using the following function:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBCopyArea (XCBConnection *c,             /* Pointer to the XCBConnection structure */
                           XCBDRAWABLE    src_drawable,  /* The Drawable we want to paste */
			   XCBDRAWABLE    dst_drawable,  /* The Drawable on which we copy the previous Drawable */
			   XCBGCONTEXT    gc,            /* A Graphic Context */
			   INT16          src_x,         /* Top left x coordinate of the region we want to copy */
			   INT16          src_y,         /* Top left y coordinate of the region we want to copy */
			   INT16          dst_x,         /* Top left x coordinate of the region where we want to copy */
			   INT16          dst_y,         /* Top left y coordinate of the region where we want to copy */
			   CARD16         width,         /* Width of the region we want to copy */
			   CARD16         height);       /* Height of the region we want to copy */
</pre>
	<p>
	As you can see, we could copy the whole pixmap, as well as
	only a given rectangle of the pixmap. This is useful to
	optimize the drawing speed: we could copy only what we have
	modified in the pixmap.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>One important note should be made</b>: it is possible to
	create pixmaps with different depths on the same screen. When
	we perform copy operations (a pixmaap onto a window, etc), we
	should make sure that both source and target have the same
	depth. If they have a different depth, the operation would
	fail. The exception to this is if we copy a specific bit plane
	of the source pixmap using the
	<span class="code">XCBCopyPlane</span> function. In such an
	event, we can copy a specific plain to the target window (in
	actuality, setting a specific bit in the color of each pixel
	copied). This can be used to generate strange graphic effects
	in widow, but beyond the scope of this tutorial.
	</p>
        <li class="subtitle"><a name="pixmapsfree"></a>Freeing a pixmap</li>
	<p>
	Finally, when we are done using a given pixmap, we should free
	it, in order to free resources of the X server. This is done
	using this function:
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
XCBVoidCookie XCBFreePixmap (XCBConnection *c,        /* Pointer to the XCBConnection structure */
                             XCBPIXMAP      pixmap);  /* A given pixmap */
</pre>
	<p>
	Of course, after having freed it, we must not try accessing
	the pixmap again.
	</p>
