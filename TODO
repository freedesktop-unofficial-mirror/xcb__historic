o Bart's list:

+ get xcb.h named correctly and in proper location.  clean
  up other header stuff.

+ split routines into one per obj file?

+ document directory and file structure.

+ rebuild for extensions in separate libraries.

+ finish xdm-auth-1.

+ fix bug with connection hanging on read w/ wrong authentication?

+ figure out how to link in Xau, XDMCP

+ inspect and test.

o Jamey's list:

Split headers into "internal" versus "external" interfaces.

De-"m4" xcb_conn.

Rename xp_core to xcb (or at least xcb_core).

Add Xlib "SyncHandle"-like functionality to all requests.
Question: should all requests SyncHandle, or only void requests?

Bugfix: GetProperty reply 'value' array length should be 'R->bytes_after'.

Add convenience functions for non-void requests which make the request and
wait for the reply in one operation.

Consider creating a structure for non-void requests containing both a cookie
and a reply pointer, so only one "thing" has to be declared.

Consider mechanism for requests and replies to declare enumerated and
bitfield types, with hidden naming convention.

Consider removing some or all references to strlen in xp_core. When what
you really want is a counted string, there's no good way to produce a
null-terminated string from it; but the other way around is easy.

Consider: should XCB error-check data from the client? From the server?

Consider allowing error handlers to be associated with void requests.

Consider mechanism for VOIDREQUESTs to report internal errors (i.e., "write
error", "extension not available") to the caller directly.

Consider writing a real compiler for the protocol description language.
