o Bart's list:

+ clean up header stuff.

+ split routines into one per obj file?

+ document directory and file structure.

+ rebuild for extensions in separate libraries.

+ finish xdm-auth-1.

+ fix bug with connection hanging on read w/ wrong authentication?

+ figure out how to link in Xau, XDMCP

+ inspect and test.

o Jamey's list:

Split headers into "internal" versus "external" interfaces.

De-"m4" xcb_conn.

Add synchronous mode support as in Xlib.

Implement iterators for all relevant data structures.

Add convenience functions for non-void requests which make the request and
wait for the reply in one operation.

Consider mechanism for requests and replies to declare enumerated and
bitfield types, with hidden naming convention.

Consider mechanism for VOIDREQUESTs to report internal errors (i.e., "write
error", "extension not available") to the caller directly.
Possibility: add additional fields to void_cookie.
Possibility: separate errors from events and generalize error structures
to allow for origins other than the server.

Consider writing a real compiler for the protocol description language.
