Xamine is a protocol analysis library for the X Window System protocol, based
on XML-XCB protocol descriptions.  Given a binary X protocol stream, Xamine
can reconstruct the structured tree of requests, replies, events, and errors.

Xamine is under heavy development; the functionality and interface are subject
to change.

Currently, Xamine only handles X events.  All the code to parse an arbitrary
description is available (though the appropriate hooks are needed to handle
some additional top-level XML tags such as request and error and pass the
contents to the structure-field-handling functions); the main task required to
handle requests and replies is the code which follows those requests and
replies in the stream, finds the appropriate XamineDescription based on the
major/minor number and a reply hash (much like XCB's mechanism), and uses that
for parsing.

The biggest limitation right now is that the caller must determine the size of
the data to pass to Xamine's parsing functions; this should definitely be
fixed, and users of the Xamine library should be able to pass arbitrary
amounts of data to Xamine until enough is available to provide parsed
structures.
